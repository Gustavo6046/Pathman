# Pathman _v0.1.1_
**A basic pathfinder and reverse planner in Java**, a simplistic AI project meant to solve arbitrary problems using the novel 2P (Planning & Pathing) model.

## What is '2P'? Two Players?
2P is short for "Planning & Pathing", a flexible and fast plan creating model where a list of Actions and Circumstances are linked in the Plan Space, before being compiled into a traversable graph in the Path Space, and then traversed and reverted to obtain the required Actions.

## How do I use?
It's a .JAR library, so you should include it as a library in your AI projects. I advise you to take a look at the example demo class included in the source code. There is also a Javadoc available.
